    "# Azure AI Search Knowledge Base with Knowledge Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure AI Search, a **knowledge base** is a top-level resource that connects a chat completion model to one or more **knowledge sources** (searchable indexes) for use in agentic retrieval workloads. It defines which data sources to query, which model to use for reasoning, and how query execution should be optimized, powering the `retrieve` method in an LLM-driven information retrieval pipeline. Once created, a knowledge base can be updated at any time, and changes will take effect the next time it’s used. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build **Knowledge Bases** with **knowledge sources**. You’ll learn how agentic retrieval works, how to create and configure a knowledge base, and how to query it for grounded, citation-backed answers while exploring the reasoning behind each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "* Connect to the existing knowledge sources that contain indexed documents\n",
    "* Create a knowledge base that uses Azure OpenAI models for intelligent retrieval\n",
    "* Query the knowledge base with natural language to get grounded, citation-backed answers\n",
    "* Explore the agentic knowledge base's activity and reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab environment has already provisioned:\n",
    "* **Azure AI Search** - Contains two pre-indexed collections: \n",
    "  - **hrdocs** (50 documents): HR policies, employee handbook, company information\n",
    "  - **healthdocs** (334 documents): Health benefits, insurance plans\n",
    "* **Azure OpenAI** - Provides chat completion (gpt-5-mini) and embedding models (text-embedding-3-large)\n",
    "* **Pre-computed vectors** - All documents are already vectorized and indexed\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes use **pre-computed embeddings**, meaning vector representations were generated during the setup process. This allows you to focus on the agentic retrieval layer without worrying about document ingestion or vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started! 🚀"

It also provides coverage for prescription drugs, mental health \\n\\nand substance abuse services, and preventive care. You can choose from a variety of in- \\n\\nnetwork providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and \\n\\npharmacies. Emergency services are also covered, both in-network and out-of-network. \\n\\nCo-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums may apply to your plan. Your plan may \\n\\nalso include separate deductibles for different services, such as prescription drugs and \\n\\nhospitalization. It is important to know what your plan covers and what the cost-sharing \\n\\nrequirements are. To get more information, please visit the Northwind Health website or \\n\\ncontact them directly. \\n\\nIt is also important to remember that there may be certain exceptions or limitations in the \\n\\nplan. For instance, some plans may not cover certain types of services, such as cosmetic \\n\\nprocedures, or they may have limits on the number of visits to a provider that are covered. \\n\\nIt is important to read through your plan to understand what is and isn\\u2019t covered. \\n\\nWhen you are using your Northwind Health Plus plan, there are a few tips to keep in mind. \\n\\nFirst, remember to bring your Northwind Health Plus ID card with you when you go to the \\n\\ndoctor or pharmacy. This will help the provider verify your coverage and process your \\n\\nclaims. Second, if you are prescribed a medication, check to make sure it is covered by your \\n\\nplan. You may be able to save money by using a generic version of the drug or by using a \\n\\nmail-order pharmacy. \\n\\nFinally, if you are seeing an out-of-network provider, remember that you may be \\n\\nresponsible for paying more out-of-pocket costs than you would for an in-network provider. \\n\\nMake sure to check with the provider to get an estimate of what your costs will be.\"\n",

    "### What You Learned: The Agentic Knowledge Base Orchestration Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focused on the **intelligence layer** that sits on top of search infrastructure. Here's the real depth of what you explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Knowledge Bases as Orchestrators**\n",
    "You built a knowledge base that doesn't just search—it **orchestrates** an entire retrieval workflow. The knowledge base coordinates between your knowledge sources (the indexed blob data) and the LLM (GPT model) to produce grounded, citation-backed answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Answer Synthesis vs. Raw Retrieval**\n",
    "Traditional search returns chunks of text. You configured **Answer Synthesis mode**, where the LLM reads retrieved passages and generates a coherent natural-language response with inline citations. This is the foundation of modern copilots and chat interfaces over enterprise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Query Decomposition & Planning**\n",
    "When you examined the **activity logs**, you saw how the knowledge base breaks complex queries into focused subqueries, executes them in parallel, and applies semantic reranking. This is agentic behavior—the system plans and adapts based on the query context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Grounding & Transparency**\n",
    "Every answer is backed by source references. You explored how to trace responses back to specific documents and passages, enabling trust and auditability in AI systems. The activity logs show exactly how the knowledge base arrived at its answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. The RAG Evolution**\n",
    "This lab demonstrated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** at scale. The knowledge base doesn't just retrieve—it reasons about what to retrieve, how to combine results, and how to synthesize coherent answers. This is next-level RAG: agentic, explainable, and production-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Return to the lab instructions page** to have a look at the summary and reflect on how **agentic behavior elevates RAG beyond simple search**, explore additional learning resources, and understand how to apply these patterns to real-world enterprise AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Experiment more!** Go back to Step 4 and try different queries—watch how the agentic knowledge base adapts its retrieval strategy based on query complexity."
